// When we made the change in step 7, we made a new version of getName() for the Bird subclass that firstly called the getName() from the parent class (super.getName())
// and then appended it to a string "The Mighty ". this means that when we call speak() for a bird, it uses the new getName() method and prefixes the name with "the Mighty "

// Bird b2 cannot be instantiated as an Animal object because Bird is a subclass of Animal, so Bird contains fields and methods not contained in Animal. An Animal is-a Bird,
// so you can store an Animal in a Bird object, but not the other way around.
